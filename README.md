### Description
This repository contains the codes used in undergraduate final project "Prototype of EEG-based Home Appliances Control System" *("Prototipe Sistem Kendali Peralatan Rumah Berbasis Elektroensefalogram")* by Sinantya F. Anindya, which was conducted in February-June 2016 in Department of Electrical Engineering, Institut Teknologi Nasional, Bandung. The codes are written in Python.

### Usage
The requirements to run the codes are as follows:
* Python 3.5
* PyQt4 (untuk Spyder)
* SciPy (NumPy, SciPy, IPython, Matplotlib, dan Scikit-Learn)
* Spyder

The datasets used for prototyping the system belong to Bakardjian et al. (2010) (http://www.bakardjian.com/work/ssvep_data_Bakardjian.html) and AVI SSVEP Dataset (http://www.setzner.com). As for the testing data collected using OpenBCI V3, they can be found within this repository.
